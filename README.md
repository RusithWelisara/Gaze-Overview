# Gaze-Overview

AI assistance inside the game editor — with developer control.

GAZE is an early-stage AI plugin designed to work inside game engines (starting with Godot) to help developers modify code and project structure safely, transparently, and intentionally.

This repository is a public overview of the project.
The core plugin code is private while the product is under active development.

## What GAZE Is

GAZE is not a “generate everything” button.

It is an AI co-pilot that:

- reads an existing project

- proposes changes

- shows diffs before anything is applied

- lets developers explicitly approve or reject edits

The goal is assist, not replace.

---

## Current Capabilities (Early MVP)

As of now, GAZE can:

- Edit GDScript files inside the Godot editor

- Generate proposed changes based on natural language instructions

- Display diffs for review

- Apply changes only after user confirmation

This is intentionally limited.
Reliability and trust come before breadth.

---

## What GAZE Is Not

- Not a new game engine

- Not a no-code toy

- Not an “AI does everything” platform

- Not a public SDK (yet)

## GAZE is being built for developers who care about:

- control

- readability

- reversibility

- real projects, not demos

---

## Development Status

GAZE is currently:

- Private alpha

- Single-file editing

- No public release yet

Public access is planned after March.

## Philosophy

AI tools fail when they:

- hide changes

- overwrite context

- break trust

GAZE is being built around one principle:

*`Nothing changes unless the developer explicitly allows it.`*
